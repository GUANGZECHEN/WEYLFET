# WEYLFET
python codes for transport in Weyl semimetals based on KWANT

The file Supplementary_A.py creates a 3D bulk Weyl semimetal where the orientation of Fermi arc surface states can be tuned, in additon, surface on-site energy and disorder can be added, longitudinal transport is computed for such system.

The file Supplementary_B.py creates a 2D cut of a 3D Weyl semimetal in momentum space, and characterizes DOS for specific bands.

Applications of Supplementary_A.py and Supplementary_B.py can be seen in 10.1063/1.5126033

The files surface_transport_disorder_euler.py as well as surface_transport_TR_disorder_euler.py creates Inversion and Time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals where orientation of Fermi arcs can be tuned. Nonlocal transport with external leads is computed for such system, results can be seen in 10.1103/PhysRevB.101.125407
